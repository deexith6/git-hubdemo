The MacBook is a brand of notebook computers manufactured by Apple Inc. from May 2006 to February 2012, and relaunched in 2015. It replaced the iBook series and 12-inch PowerBook series of notebooks as a part of the Apple-Intel transition from PowerPC. Positioned as the low end of the MacBook family, below the premium ultra-portable MacBook Air and the powerful MacBook Pro,[3] the MacBook was aimed at the consumer and education markets.[4] It was the best-selling Macintosh ever. For five months in 2008, it was the best-selling laptop of any brand in US retail stores.[5] Collectively, the MacBook brand is the "world's top-selling line of premium laptops."[6]
